# CoFI-Example-Compaction-Model
An example of using CoFI to develop the compaction model of the Northern Carnarvon Basin 
This compactin model can be used to predict and quantify exhumation within Australian Sedimentary basins
To run the model, download the Compaction Data.csv file into your local/online drive 
Download the jupyter notebook, then run it either as a jupyter notebook or a colab sheet
To run it on your data, make sure you arrange the sonic transit time and depth data similarly to the Compaction Data.csv file 
Then run the notebook
